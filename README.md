## Motivations and Goals
- There are many (hundreds!) videos of rotary inverted pendulum on the internet but I couldn't find good documentation on how to build one and how to control one
- Balancing a pendulum is the RL "hello world"
- Seems like a good platform to run RL experiments  (offline RL? [transfer from sim to robot?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTDkYFZFWug)?)
