### Note
- I had to cut down some of the M3x6mm screws listed above for them to fit with the printed shaft colars. Also, when tightening too hard the threaded inserts can come off.  
If you can source 8mm shaft collars you are better off doing that.
- I got my slip ring second hand with the label scratched off. The one listed above is the closest thing I found on Digikey. You need a slip ring for data transmission (low amperage) with at least 5 wires.
- I use a lab power supply I got off ebay for about 50EUR. You can definitely get away with something cheaper as long as it matches your motor stall current (1.8A for the one listed above).

## Required Tools for the Build
- 3D Printer (or access to one)
- A soldering iron to set the threaded inserts and solder connectors.
- A Dupont Crimping Kit (AWG28-18) to make nice wires and connectors. I got mine [from Amazon](https://www.amazon.fr/Kamtop-Sertissage-Sertisseuse-Connecteurs-0-1-1-0mm²/dp/B078K9DT69) for <30EUR.
- A decent wire stripper also helps. I like [this one](https://www.amazon.fr/Jokari-T20050-Pince-dénuder-automatique/dp/B002BDNL4Q/) very much.
